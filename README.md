# chirpradio-archiver

This is a long running program that listens to the live
[CHIRP Radio](http://chirpradio.org/) broadcast
stream and saves archive files to disk, one file per hour. It is the successor
to the archiving scripts in
[chirpradio-machine](https://github.com/chirpradio/chirpradio-machine/).

**IMPORTANT**: This is intended for internal station use only where we connect
directly to our streaming box. Please don't archive the live broadcast yourself
because CHIRP Radio pays per listener.

## Usage

Install [golang](http://golang.org/), clone this repository and start archiving like this:

    cd chirpradio-archiver/
    go run archiver.go

## Architecture

This program utilizes goroutines for robust and precise archiving. Here are some
notes:

1. A dedicated stream channel reads audio continously into a buffer so that no
   audio is ever lost.
2. Go's `time.Ticker` keeps the archive file rotation on time.
3. If there are errors when processing the stream, they are retried several
   times to recover if possible.

## Developers

To make changes or add features, you can run the test suite like this:

    go test

## Bugs?

Probably! You can report them on the github issue tracker.
